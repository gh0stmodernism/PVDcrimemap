Transparency + Community = Safety 

HELLO PROVIDENCE 

I created this map for the sole purpose of community transparancy and authoritative accountabilty. 
Crime has spiked nationwide and Providence specifically has a significant property theft problem. 
This summer alone there have been hundreds of break-ins. Yet members of the community are in the dark.
Despite crime data being made publicly available on the Providence case log portal, many are unaware of what is happening in their neighborhoods. 
Knowledge is power. If communities are aware of these crimes happening then certainly more can be done to prevent them from happening. 
When something is wrong with our bodies, we go to the doctor (if you have insurance anyway...) 
If something is wrong with our communities, where do we go? The police are like the ER: a last resort. We need preventitive care for our city. 
That's where the safety equation comes in. Transparancy plus community equals safety (for lack of a better word.) 
We all use our phones for everything, why not for keeping our neighbors aware of crimes taking place? 
My hope for this map is that it is used as a blueprint for community safety. 
Disclaimer: I am not advocating for dissolvong strutueral public safgety systems. We need the police, and despite egregious grievances against members of the black commuity there has been a lot of good done by them. It is not an easy job. However, their job is to serve and protect. Hundreds of break-ins in a small city points to some lack of accountabilty on their end. 
Disclaimer: I am not advocating for renegade justice or Robin Hooding. However, several studies have shown the efficacy of community patrols. This can be done without leaving the house: by keeping tabs of crimes in the neighborhood, members of the community are armed with knowledge that may help mitgate future crimes. 
We are all in this together. Stay woke. And be kind ㋡
