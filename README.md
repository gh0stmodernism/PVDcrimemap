Transparency + Community = Safety 

HELLO PROVIDENCE 

I created this map for the sole purpose of community transparancy and authoritative accountabilty. 
Crime has spiked nationwide and Providence specifically has a significant property theft problem. 
This summer alone there have been hundreds of break-ins. Yet members of the community are in the dark.
Despite crime data being made publicly available on the Providence case log portal, many are unaware of what is happening in their neighborhoods. 
Knowledge is power. If communities are aware of these crimes happening then certainly more can be done to prevent them. 

When something is wrong with our bodies, we go to the doctor (if you have insurance anyway...) 
If something is wrong with our communities, where do we go? The police are like the ER: a last resort. We need preventitive care for our city. 
That's where the safety equation comes in. Transparency plus community equals safety (for lack of a better word.) 
We all use our phones for everything, why not for keeping our neighbors aware of crimes taking place? 
My hope for this map is that it is used as a blueprint for community safety. 

Disclaimer #1 : I am not advocating for dissolving structural public safety systems. We need the police. While egregious grievances against members of the black community have taken place, and been rightfully addressed and protested, the fact of the matter is police are not going anywhere. Their job is to protect and serve, and a society recovering from a pandemic year and experiencing surging crime, we need them to do their job. It is not an easy job to do ny any means. 

However, many Providence residents feel as though they are being neither protected or served. Hundreds of unsolved break-ins in a small city points to some lack of accountabilty or departmental oversight on their end. Perhaps it is due to a lack of structural organization or employee burnout, but we as a community feel as though we are not being protected. I myself have been a victim of a recent crime and when I gave my statement I was laughed at and belittled by a member of Providence PD. I am sure this is a 'bad apple' type of scenario, but it was devastating to be kicked while I was already down and vulnerable. This is not how we treat our citizens, especially those who have been victims of a serious crime. This experience made me realize the property theft problem was two-fold: a proliferation of crimes as well as a disorganized public safety system. This is where informing communities comes in: knowledge! is! power! 

Disclaimer #2 : I am NOT advocating for renegade justice or Robin Hooding. However, several studies have shown the efficacy of community patrols, specifically virtual surveillance. This can be done without ever leaving the house: by merely keeping tabs of crimes in the neighborhood, members of the community are armed with knowledge that may help mitgate future crimes. My PVD crime map is all about harnessing the power of technology to keep tabs on crimes happening in the community.  

Disclaimer #3: While all crime data is public, all reports are anonymous and personal details are left out to ensure complete confidentiality. 

We are all in this together. Stay woke. And be kind ㋡
